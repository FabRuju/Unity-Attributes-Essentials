# Unity-Attributes-Essentials
Welcome to the Unity Attributes Essentials package! 🎮

This package provides a collection of essential custom attributes for Unity, designed to enhance your workflow and improve the organization of your scripts. Included are attributes such as Headers, Help Boxes, and Hyperlinks to make your code more readable and maintainable.

I'll be regularly updating this repository as I upload YouTube videos explaining the basics of these attributes and how to effectively use them in your Unity projects. Stay tuned for more content and features!

PD: The videos are in spanish, if I recieve enough support on this package I will consider doing english versions too! =)

Happy coding! 🚀
