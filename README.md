# Unity-Attributes-Essentials
Welcome to the Unity Attributes Essentials package! ðŸŽ®

This package provides a collection of essential custom attributes for Unity, designed to enhance your workflow and improve the organization of your scripts. Included are attributes such as Headers, Help Boxes, and Hyperlinks to make your code more readable and maintainable.

I'll be regularly updating this repository as I upload YouTube videos explaining the basics of these attributes and how to effectively use them in your Unity projects. Stay tuned for more content and features!

PD: The videos are in spanish, if I recieve enough support on this package I will consider doing english versions too! =)

Happy coding! ðŸš€

# Usage
H1 Attribute Constructors

```c#
//You can use it just like Unity's [Header("")], it is bigger tho

[H1("This is a header 1")]
public int someVariable;
```
```c#
/*You can customize the Text and BackgroundColor, the HEX strings are OPTIONAL
  to place, you can even only put the HEX_TextColor if you want*/

[H1("This is a header 1", "#HEX_TextColor", "#HEX_BackgroundColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", "#HEX_TextColor")]
public int someVariable;
```
```c#
/*You can customize the TopSpacing as well like this, the HEX strings are OPTIONAL
  to place, you can even only put the HEX_TextColor if you want*/

[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing, "#HEX_TextColor", "#HEX_BackgroundColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing, "#HEX_TextColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing)]
public int someVariable;
```
```c#
/*You can customize the Alignment as well like this, the HEX strings are OPTIONAL
  to place, you can even only put the HEX_TextColor if you want. I'm covering what
  GUIalignment is and how to use it below*/

[H1("This is a header 1", GUIalignment, "#HEX_TextColor", "#HEX_BackgroundColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", GUIalignment, "#HEX_TextColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", GUIalignment)]
public int someVariable;
```
```c#
/*Or you can customize all at once like this, the HEX strings are OPTIONAL
  to place, you can even only put the HEX_TextColor if you want. I'm covering what
  GUIalignment is and how to use it below*/

[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing, GUIalignment, "#HEX_TextColor", "#HEX_BackgroundColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing, GUIalignment, "#HEX_TextColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing, GUIalignment)]
public int someVariable;
```

H1, H2, H3 works the same way. So it is pretty much the same

* For example *

```c#
[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing, GUIalignment, "#HEX_TextColor", "#HEX_BackgroundColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H2("This is a header 2, a little bit smaller than header 1", (float) spacing, GUIalignment, "#HEX_TextColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H3("This is a header 3, the smallest of all of the Headers", (float) spacing, GUIalignment)]
public int someVariable;
```
