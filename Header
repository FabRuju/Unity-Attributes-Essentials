# Usage of H1, H2, H3 Attributes
H1, H2, H3 Attribute Constructors

```c#
//You can use it just like Unity's [Header("")], it is bigger tho

[H1("This is a header 1")]
public int someVariable;
```
```c#
/*You can customize the Text and BackgroundColor, the HEX strings are OPTIONAL
  to place, you can even only put the HEX_TextColor if you want*/

[H1("This is a header 1", "#HEX_TextColor", "#HEX_BackgroundColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", "#HEX_TextColor")]
public int someVariable;
```
```c#
/*You can customize the TopSpacing as well like this, the HEX strings are OPTIONAL
  to place, you can even only put the HEX_TextColor if you want*/

[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing, "#HEX_TextColor", "#HEX_BackgroundColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing, "#HEX_TextColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing)]
public int someVariable;
```
```c#
/*You can customize the Alignment as well like this, the HEX strings are OPTIONAL
  to place, you can even only put the HEX_TextColor if you want. I'm covering what
  GUIalignment is and how to use it below*/

[H1("This is a header 1", GUIalignment, "#HEX_TextColor", "#HEX_BackgroundColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", GUIalignment, "#HEX_TextColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", GUIalignment)]
public int someVariable;
```
```c#
/*Or you can customize all at once like this, the HEX strings are OPTIONAL
  to place, you can even only put the HEX_TextColor if you want. I'm covering what
  GUIalignment is and how to use it below*/

[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing, GUIalignment, "#HEX_TextColor", "#HEX_BackgroundColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing, GUIalignment, "#HEX_TextColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing, GUIalignment)]
public int someVariable;
```

H1, H2, H3 works the same way. So it is pretty much the same

* For example *

```c#
[H1("This is a header 1", (float) spacing, GUIalignment, "#HEX_TextColor", "#HEX_BackgroundColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H2("This is a header 2, a little bit smaller than header 1", (float) spacing, GUIalignment, "#HEX_TextColor")]
public int someVariable;

[H3("This is a header 3, the smallest of all of the Headers", (float) spacing, GUIalignment)]
public int someVariable;
```
BE CAREFUL, both the Text and Background HEX colors won't work if you dont put "#" at the begining
For example: "#FFFFFF"

#  What is GUIalignment?
It is a enum holding various types of built-in alignments

```c#
GUIalignment.UpLeft => //Allign text to the UpperLeft part
GUIalignment.UpCenter => //Allign tex to the UpperCenter part
GUIalignment.UpRight => //Allign text to the UpperRight part

GUIalignment.MidLeft => //Allign text to the MiddleLeft part
GUIalignment.MidCenter => //Allign text to the MiddleCenter part
GUIalignment.MidRight => //Allign text to the MiddleRight part

GUIalignment.BottomLeft => //Allign text to the LowerLeft part
GUIalignment.BottomCenter => //Allign text to the LowerCenter part
GUIalignment.BottomRight => //Allign text to the LowerRight part
```
